## Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that has two functions where you can play against a friend or against the AI.

Rules:
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on the three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled resulting in a draw.

Known bugs:
1: When the game is won on the last move it will display as a draw.
2: On 'play with friend' mode, you can switch player back to keep using the same icon.
3: If draw on 'AIEasy' mode the AI will continue to loop.
4: If win comes with two directions the score increases by two.
5: Need to reset playerOne to true when HardAI game is finished.
